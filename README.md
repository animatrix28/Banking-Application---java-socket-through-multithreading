# Banking-Application---java-socket-through-multithreading
Banking application is done using java socket programming to show how transactions are done when multiple client access the server at the same time i.e. distributed system for banking application.
zip file consists of program and in documentation.pdf file, detail of the program is explained and also how comparision between rpc and rmi is also explained.
To run the program you need to create database in your sql server with names as defined in the document and then run the program by running bankserver.java first and then client.java.
To execute multiple client and access the bankserver at the same time then run client.java file multiple times(number of times client.java file runs that many client is created).

In documentation I have shown only for two clients so only two database i have created and ran the client program two times which made two clients connected to the server.
Also comparision between RPC and RMI is explained with sample programs
